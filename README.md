2. **Eraser**: A tool to remove unwanted parts of the drawing.

3. **Color Picker**: Allows users to select custom colors for their artwork.

4. **Undo/Redo**: Provides the ability to undo or redo recent actions.

5. **Clear Canvas**: A function to start over by clearing the entire canvas.

6. **Save/Export**: Enables users to save their creations or export them in common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

7. **Basic Shapes**: Options to draw simple shapes like lines, rectangles, and circles.

8. **No Layers or Advanced Features**: Unlike more complex graphic design software, a simple paint web app usually lacks layers, advanced filters, or intricate editing capabilities.

This type of app is great for quick sketches, basic creative projects, and for users who prefer a minimalistic approach to digital drawing without the complexity of advanced tools. It's often used by beginners, children, or anyone looking for a straightforward way to engage in digital art without a steep learning curve.
